Galton is a service that can be used to extract metadata from many common file types. It utilizes Apache Tika (https://tika.apache.org/) under the hood.

Galton is used to power the https://metadata.exposed site. If you do not want to upload your files, you can install and run it locally.

Local installation:
 - Install Ruby
 - Install a Java JDK
 - Install bundler gem & run 'bundle install' in the directory
 - Run the application 'bundle exec ruby ./galton.rb'
