Galton is a service that can be used to extract metadata from many common file types. It utilizes Apache Tika (https://tika.apache.org/) under the hood.

Galton is used to power the https://metadata.exposed site. If you do not want to upload your files, you can install and run it locally.

Local installation:
 (1) install Ruby
 (2) install a Java JDK
 (3) install bundler gem & run 'bundle install' in the directory
 (4) run the application 'bundle exec ruby ./galton.rb'
